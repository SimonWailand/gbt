;; Addresses Representations
;; An address in a generalized balanced ternary space of
;; dimension n has a canonical form of an integer with a base
;; of 2^(n+1)-1. Its standard form is a vector of the digits
;; of that integer represented as bit strings of length n+1
;; e.g. GBT2
;; canonical: 34 (base 7)
;; base10: 25
;; standard: [100 011] (little endian)
;; bit string digits in standard form are currently
;; just the low bits of Longs/Numbers.
